# Stratagem: A Nonlinear Match-3 Game for the PICO-8

Stratagem (originally named Gemini) is a match-3 game for the
[PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php) where you swap
adjacent gems on a grid to gain points. Unlike other popular match-3 games, any
group of gems that directly touch on the grid are cleared, not just ones that
are in the same row or column.

While you can make any move on the board that swaps two touching gems, you can
only make three moves that don't clear groups of gems before the game is over.

## Build Instructions

The included Makefile uses
[`picotool`](https://www.dansanderson.com/projects/picotool/) to assemble and
apply operations to the cartridge parts. Simply run the following code to
download and run Stratagem on your machine (assuming the PICO-8 executable is on
your PATH).

```bash
git clone github.com/vm70/stratagem
cd stratagem
make
```
