</div>

_Stratagem_ is a match-3 game for the
[PICO-8 fantasy console](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). The objective
of the game is to get as many points as possible by swapping adjacent gems on a
grid to clear touching groups on the grid. Spend your chances to make wrong
non-matching moves wisely; once you run out, it's game over!

## Build Instructions

The included Makefile automatically downloads and installs
[`picotool`](https://www.dansanderson.com/projects/picotool/) for assembling and
modifying the PICO-8 cartridge's parts. You can run the following script to
download and run _Stratagem_ on your machine (assuming the PICO-8 executable is
on your PATH).

```bash
git clone github.com/vm70/stratagem
cd stratagem
make
```
